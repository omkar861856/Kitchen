# Canteen Web-App

## Vision Statement
This project aims to digitize small-scale internal canteens for government offices. The goal is to provide an integrated solution:
- A user-facing app to browse menus, place orders, make payments, and track order statuses.
- A kitchen-side app to manage menu items, incoming orders, and preparation workflow.
  
**Tech Stack:**  
- **Frontend:** React (TypeScript), Vite  
- **Backend:** Node.js, Express.js, Mongoose (MongoDB), WebSockets for real-time updates  
- **Authentication:** Clerk  
- **Deployment:** A single backend server serving both the user-side and kitchen-side apps.

We are currently focusing on building an MVP for demonstration, with the potential to scale into a subscription service for multiple canteens and clients in the future.

## Configuration & Environment Setup

### .env Files
You will need to set up two environment files:  
1. **`.env.development`** (for local development on `localhost`)  
2. **`.env.production`** (for the deployed environment on a server)

**Example:**
```env
# .env.development
VITE_API_URL="http://localhost:3000" 

VITE_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY="your_clerk_publishable_key_for_development"

# .env.production
VITE_API_URL="https://your-deployed-backend-link.com"

VITE_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY="your_clerk_publishable_key_for_production"

## Generate API Keys on Clerk
Create or use your existing project in Clerkâ€™s Dashboard to generate the publishable key. This will be used for authentication and is required to be set in both .env.development and .env.production.
